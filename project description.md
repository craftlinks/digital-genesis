# Project Title: Digital Genesis - Creating Life from Virtual Chemistry

This project aims to simulate spontaneous artificial life generation and open-ended evolution through developing a framework to design, test and optimize artificial chemistry rules.

## What is artificial life?

Artificial life is the study of life-like behavior that emerges from artificial systems, rather than biological ones.
Just like how life on Earth emerged from basic chemical processes, artificial life aims to create systems (usually computer simulations) where life-like properties develop spontaneously
from simple rules and components.
When we talk about "life-like" properties, we mean things like the ability to maintain and repair oneself, reproduce, evolve, and adapt to changes in the environment.
The key is that life-like properties (self-maintenance, reproduction, evolution) aren't programmed directly into the system - they emerge naturally from the underlying rules,
just as biological life emerged from the basic chemistry of early Earth.

## what is an artificial chemistry?

Artificial chemistry is a formal system of rules and interactions that may or may not have any connection to real-world chemistry.
While these systems can be inspired by real chemistry, they don't need to be - they can follow completely arbitrary rules we invent.
We can then "run" this system to see what kinds of patterns and behaviors emerge from these rules, regardless of whether they reflect anything in the physical world.
This makes artificial chemistry a powerful toolfor studying abstract concepts like self-organization,emergence, and evolution in rule-based systems more generally.
It is assumed that an artificial chemistry system, with sufficiently rich and open-ended rules, could potentially give rise to increasingly complex structures and behaviors
that mirror characteristics we associate with life.

## Possible Rules and their formalization

To create an artificial chemistry system that could potentially give rise to life-like behaviors, 
we need to define a comprehensive set of rules that govern how components interact. 
These rules must be precise enough to be implemented computationally while allowing for the emergence of complex behaviors. 
Below are key categories of rules that could form the foundation of such a system.

### 1. **Atoms and Bonds**
   - **Define Atoms as Data Units:** Each "atom" can be a data structure with properties like:
   - Identity $A$, $B$, $C$, $\dots$ .
     - Valency (number of bonds it can form, e.g., 1, 2, 3).
     - Bond Strength (energy required to break it).
     - Reactivity (probability of participating in reactions).
   - **Define Bonds as Connections:** Bonds are defined by relationships between atoms:
     - \( A \leftrightarrow B \) indicates a bond between \( A \) and \( B \).
     - Store bond strength and type (e.g., single, double, etc.).

---

### 2. **Energy Rules**
   - **Energy Levels:**
     - Assign each atom or molecule an energy value.
     - Define energy changes (\( \Delta E \)) for forming or breaking bonds.
   - **Reaction Trigger:** A reaction occurs if the system has enough energy to overcome bond-breaking requirements and is energy-favorable overall:
     \[
     \Delta E = E_{\text{break}} - E_{\text{form}}
     \]
     If \( \Delta E < 0 \), the reaction occurs spontaneously.
   - **Formalization:**
     - \( \text{If } E_{\text{input}} \geq E_{\text{break}} \text{, then bonds can break.} \)
     - \( \text{If } \Delta E \leq 0 \text{, then products are more stable and reaction proceeds.} \)

---

### 3. **Reaction Rules**
   - **Collision-Based Interactions:**
     - Reactions occur when "atoms" or "molecules" collide.
     - Define probabilities for collisions leading to reactions based on parameters like temperature or concentration.
   - **Reaction Pathways:**
     - Use rules like \( A + B \rightarrow C \) or \( A + BC \rightarrow AB + C \).
   - **Formalization:**
     - \( \text{Reactants } R_1 + R_2 \text{ form products if } E_{\text{collision}} \geq \text{threshold.} \)
     - Define a lookup table of possible reaction outcomes for each pair of reactants.

---

### 4. **Conservation Laws**
   - **Mass Conservation:** The total number of atoms remains constant during a reaction.
     \[
     \text{Sum of inputs} = \text{Sum of outputs.}
     \]
   - **Energy Conservation:** Energy is conserved during reactions. Define whether energy changes result in heat, light, or other outputs.
   - **Formalization:** Track all atoms and energy units before and after reactions.

---

### 5. **Stability and Decay**
   - **Molecule Stability:** Define "stable" configurations where bonds are strong, and energy is minimized.
   - **Spontaneous Decay:** Unstable molecules may decompose randomly over time.
     - Add a time-dependent rule where bonds with low stability probabilities break after a random duration.
   - **Formalization:** Assign each molecule a stability score. If \( \text{score} < \text{threshold}, \text{ decay occurs.} \)

---

### 6. **Catalysts and Inhibitors**
   - **Catalysts:** Define special "atoms" or "molecules" that lower reaction energy barriers without being consumed.
     - \( \text{If Catalyst C present, then } E_{\text{required}} = E_{\text{break}} / 2. \)
   - **Inhibitors:** Prevent reactions by stabilizing reactants or raising energy barriers.
     - \( \text{If Inhibitor I present, then } E_{\text{required}} = E_{\text{break}} \times 2. \)

---

### 7. **Environment and External Energy Sources**
   - **Temperature:** Affects the kinetic energy of molecules.
     \[
     \text{Higher temperature } \rightarrow \text{more frequent collisions, more reactions.}
     \]
   - **Light/Electricity:** Add rules where external energy sources provide activation energy.
     - \( \text{If photon energy } \geq \text{bond energy, bonds break.} \)

---

### 8. **Formal Representation and Computation**
   - Represent reactions as graphs:
     - Atoms = Nodes.
     - Bonds = Edges.
   - Use computational rules like cellular automata or stochastic simulations to evolve the system.
   - Define time steps for each interaction to simulate progression.

---

### 9. **Programmable Rulesets**
   - Allow rules to evolve or adapt based on feedback (e.g., mutation of reaction pathways).
   - Introduce randomness to simulate real-world variability in chemical reactions.

---

### Example: Simple Artificial Chemistry Rule Set
1. Define Atoms: \( A (valency=1), B (valency=2), C (valency=1) \).
2. Define Bonds:
   - \( A \leftrightarrow B \): Strong bond, requires 10 energy units to break.
   - \( B \leftrightarrow C \): Weak bond, requires 5 energy units to break.
3. Define Reactions:
   - \( A + B \rightarrow AB \) (exothermic, releases 5 energy units).
   - \( AB + C \rightarrow ABC \) (requires 3 energy units).
4. Stability Rule:
   - \( ABC \) is stable and does not decay spontaneously.

---

Such a framework can simulate real-world chemical principles while being computationally efficient and allowing emergent behaviors.

## Sampling of Artificial Chemistry Rule Sets

Taking this approach of an artificial chemistry, there exists an infinite space of possible rule sets that could define distinct artificial chemistry systems.
By systematically generating and simulating rule sets, and analyzing features like reaction cycles, molecule diversity, and energy flow, you can explore the vast landscape of artificial chemistries and identify those with emergent,
"interesting" properties. Focusing on cycles is a strong start, as they often lead to sustained and complex behaviors akin to biological systems.
To explore the vast rule space, we need a strategy to generate, sample, and evaluate rule sets:

#### **a) Rule Generation**
- **Parameter Space Definition:**
  Define a parameterized space for your artificial chemistry rules, e.g.:
  - Number of atom types (\( A, B, C \)).
  - Valency limits (e.g., max bonds an atom can form).
  - Bond strengths and energy requirements.
  - Reaction types (e.g., binary collisions, catalyst-driven, etc.).
- **Stochastic Rule Creation:**
  Generate rule sets randomly within this parameterized space:
  - Randomly assign bond strengths and formation/breaking rules.
  - Randomly assign reaction pathways (e.g., \( A + B \rightarrow C \), \( C \rightarrow A + D \)).
  - Randomize initial conditions (molecule populations, energy levels).

#### **b) Sampling Strategies**
1. **Random Sampling:**  
   Select rule sets uniformly from the parameter space.
2. **Guided Sampling:**  
   Bias the sampling toward parameter ranges more likely to yield "interesting" outcomes, e.g.:
   - Moderate energy thresholds (avoiding trivial or impossible reactions).
   - Valencies that allow for complexity (e.g., not all atoms having valency 1).
3. **Evolutionary Algorithms:**  
   Use genetic algorithms to evolve rule sets toward predefined criteria (e.g., higher complexity or cyclic reactions).

## Selection criteria for "Interesting" Rule Sets

When evaluating artificial chemistry rule sets, we need criteria to identify which ones are most likely to lead to
interesting emergent behaviors and potentially artificial life. 
Key indicators include the system's ability to generate increasing complexity over time, support self-organizing structures,
and enable evolution through inheritance and variation. 
We should look for rule sets that allow for stable but flexible molecular structures, cyclic reaction patterns that could support metabolism-like processes,
and the potential for information storage and transfer between components. 
The presence of autocatalytic cycles, where products of reactions catalyze their own production, is particularly promising as it mimics core features of biological systems.

#### **a) Reaction Cycles**
- **Why Theyâ€™re Interesting:**
  Cycles suggest **self-sustaining reaction networks** that can form the basis for emergent behaviors, like autocatalysis or metabolic-like processes.
- **Detection:**
  - Represent reactions as a directed graph:
    - Nodes = molecules.
    - Edges = reactions (directed from reactants to products).
  - Use graph algorithms to detect cycles (e.g., Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components).
- **Example Metric:**
  Number, size, and complexity of cycles in the reaction network.

#### **b) Diversity of Molecules**
- **Why Itâ€™s Interesting:**
  Systems that generate a large variety of molecules tend to exhibit richer emergent behavior.
- **Metric:**
  Count unique molecules formed during a simulation.
- **Detection:**
  Run simulations starting from a small set of initial molecules and measure how many distinct products are formed.

#### **c) Energy Flow and Efficiency**
- **Why Itâ€™s Interesting:**
  Systems with efficient energy use or emergent energy storage resemble real-world metabolic systems.
- **Metric:**
  - Measure energy released versus energy required in the system.
  - Look for self-regulating energy cycles.

#### **d) Self-Sustaining Networks**
- **Why Itâ€™s Interesting:**
  Systems that maintain activity over long periods (without external input) are analogous to living systems.
- **Metric:**
  Measure time to decay (how long the system keeps reacting without energy injection).

#### **e) Emergent Behavior**
- **Why Itâ€™s Interesting:**
  Complexity that arises spontaneously, such as hierarchical reaction networks or replication-like processes, can be analogs of life or other natural systems.
- **Metric:**
  - Detection of repeating patterns in reaction graphs.
  - Growth in molecular complexity (e.g., increasing molecule sizes over time).

#### **f) System Complexity**
- **Why Itâ€™s Interesting:**
  High complexity often leads to emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict.
- **Metric:**
  Use measures like Shannon entropy on the reaction graph or population dynamics of molecules.

## **Detecting Interestingness**

1. **Generate Rule Sets:**
   - Use random, guided, or evolutionary sampling methods to create candidate rule sets.

2. **Simulate Reaction Dynamics:**
   - For each rule set, initialize a system with some starting molecules.
   - Run simulations for a fixed number of steps or until the system stabilizes.

3. **Build Reaction Graph:**
   - Log all reactions that occur.
   - Create a directed graph where:
     - Nodes = unique molecules.
     - Edges = reactions converting one molecule to another.

4. **Analyze Interestingness:**
   - Use predefined metrics to evaluate each system:
     - Number/complexity of cycles in the reaction graph.
     - Diversity of molecules produced.
     - Energy efficiency and flow.
     - Time to decay.
   - Score each system based on these metrics.

5. **Iterate and Refine:**
   - Focus sampling on promising regions of the rule space (e.g., rule sets yielding many cycles).
   - Use machine learning models to predict interesting rule sets based on observed patterns.

---

### Example Metric Combination for Reaction Cycles
For a focus on reaction cycles, your scoring function might look like this:
\[
\text{Score} = w_1 \cdot C + w_2 \cdot D + w_3 \cdot T
\]
Where:
- \( C \): Number of cycles in the reaction graph.
- \( D \): Diversity of unique molecules.
- \( T \): Time to decay or stabilization.
- \( w_1, w_2, w_3 \): Weights reflecting the importance of each factor.
